## The Money Vikings RSI
* This pine script can be imported into tradingview so the RSI changes colors when it's overbought (red) or oversold (blue)
* Gradient color RSI will help the Vikings determine if they are sailing the seas for their next pillage (Oversold), or blood on the land that will send them back to the seas to fight another day (Overbought). 
* The color gradient helps to easily identify the current situation of the sentiment. 
* The High/Low bands are set at a standard 70 and 30. An Oversold situation will be identified with an aqua blue and an Overbought situation will be identified with red. Revisions expected in the future.
